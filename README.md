# Recipe-Finder-Application

This is version 1.1 of the application as of creating this repository.
There has been several fixes since 1.0.

As the name suggests this is an application that i have been working on for quite some time, and 
it is about the ability to make yourself a dish/cook food with the ingredients you have at home
and not go to the shop to search for them. Kinda like the easier(lame) version of the food sites,
but the other way around.

As of right now the program uses Java/Spring boot for the backend and Angular for frontent.
In later stages i want to make it available to Android, Windows Application and maybe
an online site of sorts so as many people can have access as possible.

This used to be my Masters's degree project, but i changed it to be a standalone project of mine.
The project is a demo, where i learn and and improve myself. 
Most notable fixes are that i need to make the code more clean and readable.
Also wanted to incorporate an AI of sorts so that the searching becomes easier and a 
seperate database, that will be active even offline that will have hundreds of food recipes.
