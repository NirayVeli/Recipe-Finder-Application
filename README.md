# Recipe-Finder-Application

This is version 1.1 of the application as of creating this repository.
There has been several fixes since 1.0.

As the name suggests this is an application that i have been working on for quite some time, and 
it is about the ability to make yourself a dish/cook food with the ingredients you have at home
and not go to the shop to search for them. Kinda like the easier(lame) version of the food sites,
but the other way around.

As of right now the program uses Java/Spring boot for the backend and Angular for frontent.
In later stages i want to make it available to Android, Windows Application and maybe
an online site of sorts so as many people can have access as possible
